# nameGame

Contains a first pass at the Willow Tree iOS Namegame! Due to time constraints, I did not include alternate game modes, a hint mode, or a team mode. I did include a bunch of fancy-pants transitions, particle effects, background music, sound effects, etc. Enjoy!

Things that I would have done next:

- Implement some sort of local persistent storage for the feed and associated images for people. Check each time a session starts if remote data has changed and only update/load the updated records

- Prioritize random person selection based on which images are loaded instead of all of them

- Alternate game modes - one variant of the existing scene per game mode, all accesable from the main menu

- Hint mode, team Mode, as with the alternate game modes

- Cleaned up the loading of images and the associated gray blocks that show until a given image is loaded

- Added additional particle effects, sound effects, have the people fly around to enter the scene instead of fading in
